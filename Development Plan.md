Survival Game (Early Draft Title)

1. Game Design for the core game: (Will be for designers to write up)
1.1 - GameMode PVE - There will be enviromental factors can will threaten the players chances of survival so they have to gather resourses and build up their base, tame creatures,  grow crops, breed creatures.
1.2 - GameMode PVP - Player verus player elements will be existing in the game where you can fight other users in combat in order to gain others resourses and ensure their own survival and staying on top of their competition.

2. Team Layout - Lead Programmer Marcus Persson. 

3. Multiplayer:
3.1 - The Steam Online Subsystem (OSS) integrates Steamworks with Unreal Engine. It provides player authentication, friends, lobbies, matchmaking, achievements, and session management.
   
3.2 - Sockets Subsystem Steam IP: Replaces Unreal’s default IP socket transport with Steam’s Networking Sockets API. Provides secure, NAT-friendly peer-to-peer and relay-based networking.
!(This will be added later in production before the game goes live (most likely passed entered the first alpha stage). In order to protect users from having their ipadresses getting spoofed while playing the game
or possibly creating backend services that may track users and figure out users steam profiles / IPAdresses. 

3.3 - Advanced Sessions Plugin - This will be integrated for designers to be able to create their own maps and systems early on while programmers focus on the main game.

3.4 - Future of Multiplayer -  If the game actually has investors and production is going steady we would use Epic Online Services as a Cross-platform Bridge.
